# archaeological-potential-predicting-Using-RF-in-NETP
The project utilizes the Random Forest (RF) model to predict archaeological potential in the northeast Tibetan Plateau. 
The folder "cultural point" contains all archaeological data required for the analysis. 
There are two R scripts included, covering preprocessing and modeling processes. 
The environmental variables data used in the R scripts can be downloaded from the internet. We have also provided a processed file named "all_point.csv," which can be used to construct models.
For further details, please refer to our publications.
